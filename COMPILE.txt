ON WINDOWS:

--- Just run the script «./Autobuild-WIN.sh».

NOTICE: tsMuxeR.exe is built without problems with the Win32-threaded GCC,
I don't know whether the «mingw-std-threads» headers work with the POSIX-threaded GCC
(i.e., the one which uses winpthreads) or not. 

=============================

ON *NIX systems:

1) Substitute the files in the directory named "linux" for their respective Win32 equivalents in the main directories "libmediation" and "muxer";

2) Run the script «./Autobuild-NIX.sh».
